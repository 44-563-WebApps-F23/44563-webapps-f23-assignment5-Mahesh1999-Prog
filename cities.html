    <h5>Explanation:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>City names are breaken first</li>
        <li>The row containing the letters ("S," "M," "I," "T," "H," "S") uses the Bootstrap grid system with the class "col-sm-2," which specifies that each column should take up 2 grid columns on small screens and larger. This means that these letters can scale down and adjust to smaller screen sizes before breaking into a new row.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, the row containing the city names ("Sydney," "Madrid," "Istanbul," "Tokyo," "Helsinki," "San Francisco") uses the class "col-md," which specifies that each column should take up the full available width on medium-sized screens and larger. This makes the city names less flexible in adjusting to smaller screen sizes, causing them to break into a new row earlier than the letters.</li>
        <li>Hence, It's important to note that the behavior observed is due to the specific Bootstrap classes applied to the columns. The choice of "col-sm-2" for the letters and "col-md" for the city names determines when they wrap to a new row based on screen size breakpoints.</li>
    </ul>
